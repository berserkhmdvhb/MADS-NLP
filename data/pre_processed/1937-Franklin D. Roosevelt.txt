let us ask reached goal vision fourth day march found happy valley
 see great nation upon great continent blessed great wealth natural resources hundred thirty million people peace among making country good neighbor among nations see united states can demonstrate democratic methods government national wealth can translated spreading volume human comforts hitherto unknown lowest standard living can raised far level mere subsistence
 challenge democracy nation see tens millions citizens— substantial part whole population— moment denied greater part lowest standards today call necessities life
 see millions families trying live incomes meager pall family disaster hangs day day
 see millions whose daily lives city farm continue conditions labeled indecent socalled polite society half century ago
 see millions denied education recreation opportunity better lot lot children
 see millions lacking means buy products farm factory poverty denying work productiveness many millions
 see onethird nation illhoused illclad illnourished
